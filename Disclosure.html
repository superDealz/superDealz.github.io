Affiliate Disclosure

FTC Disclosure Compliance Rules.
In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission released their new rules for Disclosure Compliance.

These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media are aware if the blogger or publisher is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered with a different company. The readers need to know if the content publisher is making money by sharing a link or product.
In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site:
Any/all of the links on SuperDealz are affiliate links for which we receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.

What Are Affiliate Links?
Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites : when a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on nonstopdeals.in to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly (not from NonStopDeals).
Amazon and/or other companies pay NonStopDeals a small commission or other compensation for helping to bring customers to their website.
Prices are exactly the same for readers whether they purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. Clicking an affiliate link and clicking a non-affiliate link does not change the price or anything else for the visitor.
SuperDealz uses two main types of affiliate programs:

1. Amazon Affiliate Links.
Superdealz.co.in is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for website owners to earn fees by linking to Amazon.in and affiliated sites, as well as to other websites that may be affiliated with Amazon Service LLC Associates Program.

2. Product Affiliate Links.
If you click a product affiliate link and buy the product, then we will get a percentage of the sale or some other type of compensation.
Again, prices are not different if you use these affiliate links. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link. These links are not “pay per click.”
